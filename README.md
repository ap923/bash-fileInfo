# bash-fileInfo

Bash script that takes the name of a file or directory as an argument,
1. reports if it is a directory or a file, and if the user has read, write and execute permission on the file or
directory, and
2. if it is a file, reports the size of the file and the category of the file based on its size. If the file size is
greater than 1MB (1048576B), the file is a large file; if the file size is less than or equal to 1MB (1048576B)
and the file size is greater than 100KB (102400B), the file is a medium file; otherwise, it is a small file.
Use a sequence of if statements on the file name or file size to determine the information.
To get the file size, use command du â€“b and command cut. Read their manual for how to use them.
